# (S)GD Over Diagonal Linear Networks

Authors: Alexandre Maranh√£o and Arthur Gallois

This repository is dedicated to reproducing the experiments from the paper [(S)GD Over Diagonal Linear Networks
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08982). It was created as part of a Master's course and has no involvement or endorsement from the authors of the paper.

### Setup 

To setup the environment, install the requirements from `requirements.txt` using the environment manager of your choice. One possibility is with venv, by executing

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Experiments

To run the experiments, execute from the repository root

```bash
python -m sgd_over_dlns.experiments.1_varying_stepsize
python -m sgd_over_dlns.experiments.2_gain_shape
python -m sgd_over_dlns.experiments.3_edge_of_stability
```

The output images will be written in a folder called `output` under the repository root.
